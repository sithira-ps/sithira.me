# A Life Changing Session

> In this post, I share insights from a transformative session on open source contributions and how it reshaped my perspective on career growth.

Today I attended a session on how to contribute to open source projects, conducted by Malinda Alahakoon and Jayasanka Weerasinghe. I was privileged to join this session as a Patreon member of Malinda Aiya's YouTube channel. He organizes these valuable sessions monthly for his Patreon community, and each one brings something special to the table.

This particular session was especially meaningful for me because it aligned perfectly with my current career plans. I'm considering leaving my job to focus on building my skills and portfolio, and open source project contribution represents an incredible opportunity to work alongside reputed developers while improving my craft.

## Learning from Jayasanka's Journey

During the session, Jaye shared his inspiring story of how he landed a Technical Lead role at OpenMRS, a renowned large-scale open source organization in the health tech industry. His journey wasn't just about technical skills—it was about persistence, community engagement, and strategic career building.

He also discussed Google Summer of Code and how participating in the program became a catalyst for his professional growth. The way he described the mentorship, the projects, and the connections he made through GSoC really opened my eyes to opportunities I hadn't fully appreciated before.

## Reflection and Regret

Even though I had heard of GSoC and open source projects throughout my journey, I never felt compelled to give them a try. During my undergraduate years, I was focused elsewhere, and even after starting my career as a Software Engineer, I remained tunnel-visioned on my day job and personal projects.

I must admit, I feel somewhat regretful that I didn't explore these opportunities earlier in my career. While exposure to open source communities and programs like GSoC existed during my university years, I simply wasn't looking in that direction. It wasn't that the opportunities weren't there—I just hadn't prioritized seeking them out or understanding their potential impact.

Looking back, I realize that career growth through open source contribution was completely off my radar. I was absorbed in other pursuits and failed to grasp the immense value these communities could provide for professional development and skill building.

## The Path Forward

This session has reinforced my decision to make a significant career change. Contributing to open source projects isn't just about building a portfolio—it's about joining a global community of developers who are passionate about creating meaningful solutions.

The technical skills, networking opportunities, and real-world project experience that come from open source contribution seem like the perfect foundation for the career pivot I'm planning. It's never too late to start, and sessions like this remind me that the best time to begin is now.

## Key Takeaways

The session left me with several important insights:

**Community matters**: Open source isn't just about code—it's about people, collaboration, and shared learning experiences.

**Start where you are**: You don't need to be an expert to begin contributing. Many projects welcome beginners and provide mentorship opportunities.

**Consistency over perfection**: Regular, meaningful contributions matter more than attempting to make a perfect first impression.

**Think long-term**: Building a reputation in open source communities takes time, but the career benefits can be transformative.

**Build a strong netowrk**: Networking emerged as the most crucial element for career growth. It's essential to establish your presence in the community and showcase your work to the world. Building meaningful connections can unlock opportunities that technical skills alone cannot provide. (Book recommendation - Show your work)

## Moving Forward

As I prepare for my career transition, I'm committed to making open source contribution a central part of my strategy. The insights from Malinda Aiya and Jaye have given me both the motivation and the roadmap I needed.

Sometimes the most valuable sessions are the ones that don't just teach you something new, but help you see possibilities you didn't know existed. Today's session was definitely one of those experiences.

You can expect more blogs about my contributions to open source projects in the future. And if I don't follow through on this commitment, feel free to call me out on it—accountability is part of the journey.
