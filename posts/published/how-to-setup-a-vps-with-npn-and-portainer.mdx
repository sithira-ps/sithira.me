# How to Setup a VPS with Nginx Proxy Manager and Portainer

> In this guide, we'll go through a lightweight alternative to CyberPanel for managing your server. By using **Nginx Proxy Manager** for reverse proxy and **Portainer** for container management, you gain more flexibility and control without the overhead of traditional web panels.

⚠️ This guide assumes your VPS is already configured with the necessary user authentication, permissions, and security hardening.

---

## 1. Initial Server Access and Update

First, access your VPS via SSH. Any SSH client will work — tools like **Termius** or your terminal are fine.

### Log in to the Server and Update System Packages

```bash
ssh root@203.54.168.221
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Replace `203.54.168.221` with your VPS's actual IP address.

---

## 2. Install Docker and Docker Compose

If Docker is not already installed on your VPS, you can install it using:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash
```

Then install Docker Compose:

```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose -y
```

Verify installation:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

---

## 3. Create a Custom Docker Network

We will create a **custom Docker network** to ensure Nginx Proxy Manager and Portainer can communicate internally.

```bash
docker network create my-proxy-network
```

This network will be referenced in both Docker Compose files.

---

## 4. Deploy Nginx Proxy Manager

Now let’s set up **Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)** to act as our reverse proxy and SSL manager.

### Step 1: Create a Folder for NPM

```bash
mkdir nginx-proxy-manager
cd nginx-proxy-manager
nano docker-compose.yml
```

### Step 2: Paste the Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  nginx-proxy-manager:
    image: 'jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest'
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: nginx-proxy-manager
    ports:
      - '80:80' # Public HTTP Port
      - '443:443' # Public HTTPS Port
      - '81:81' # Admin Web Port (Access NPM UI here)
    volumes:
      - ./npm-data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
    networks:
      - my-proxy-network

networks:
  my-proxy-network:
    external: true
```

### Step 3: Start the Container

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can now access Nginx Proxy Manager via `http://your-server-ip:81`.

Default credentials:

- **Email**: `admin@example.com`
- **Password**: `changeme`

---

## 5. Deploy Portainer

Now we’ll set up **Portainer** to manage your Docker containers via a GUI.

### Step 1: Navigate to Root and Create a Folder

```bash
cd ..
mkdir portainer
cd portainer
nano docker-compose.yml
```

### Step 2: Paste the Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  portainer:
    image: portainer/portainer-ce:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: portainer
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - portainer_data:/data
    networks:
      - my-proxy-network

volumes:
  portainer_data:

networks:
  my-proxy-network:
    external: true
```

### Step 3: Start the Container

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

By default, Portainer runs on port 9000, but we won't expose this port directly. Instead, we'll use Nginx Proxy Manager to route traffic securely.

---

## 6. Configure Domain and Secure Access via Nginx Proxy Manager

To expose Portainer securely over HTTPS:

1. **Create a subdomain** for Portainer (e.g., `portainer.yourdomain.com`). You can do this using the advanced DNS settings provided by your domain registrar.

2. **Point the subdomain** to your server's public IP (`203.54.168.221`) using an A record.

3. **Log in to Nginx Proxy Manager** at `http://yourdomain.com:81`.

4. Navigate to **Proxy Hosts** → **Add Proxy Host**.

5. Fill in the following details:

   * **Domain Names**: `portainer.yourdomain.com`
   * **Scheme**: `http`
   * **Forward Hostname / IP**: `portainer` (this should match the container name)
   * **Forward Port**: `9000`
   * **Cache Assets**: ✅
   * **Block Common Exploits**: ✅
   * **Websockets Support**: ✅

6. Switch to the **SSL** tab, request a new **Let’s Encrypt certificate**, and agree to the terms of service. Also, enable the following (optional but recommended):

   * **Force SSL**: ✅
   * **HTTP/2 Support**: ✅
   * **HSTS Enabled**: ✅
   * **HSTS Include Subdomains**: ✅

Once saved, you’ll be able to access Portainer securely via `https://portainer.yourdomain.com`.

---

## ✅ You're Done!

You now have:

- **Nginx Proxy Manager** handling your reverse proxies and SSL.
- **Portainer** managing your Docker containers.
- A lightweight, modular alternative to CyberPanel.

---

## End Note

I previously used CyberPanel to manage my VPS, but found it to be resource-heavy and packed with features I rarely used. It consumed a noticeable amount of system resources, which wasn’t ideal for my minimal and container-based setup.

That’s why I switched to this lightweight alternative using Nginx Proxy Manager and Portainer. It’s modular, efficient, and gives me full control over my Docker environment without unnecessary overhead.

These are the exact steps I followed to configure my own VPS, and the setup has served me reliably so far.
