# Why I Struggle to Finish Things

>This is a personal reflection on why I keep jumping from one project to another without finishing â€” driven by excitement, perfectionism, and Shiny Object Syndrome. I explore the mindset behind it and share the small but practical changes Iâ€™m making to finally break the cycle and follow through.

Iâ€™ve started countless projects with an almost irrational level of excitement. Whether itâ€™s a new app, a side hustle, a tech experiment, or a passion-fueled idea, I dive in headfirst â€” grinding day and night for a solid 4 or 5 days. And thenâ€¦ it fades.

The energy? Gone.  
The focus? Scattered.  
The project? Unfinished.

Instead of wrapping up what I started, I get pulled into the next exciting idea â€” the "new shiny thing."

## âœ¨ The Shiny Object Syndrome Is Real

If you've never heard of it, **Shiny Object Syndrome (SOS)** is what happens when we constantly chase new ideas or opportunities â€” not because theyâ€™re better, but because theyâ€™re *new*. It's the dopamine hit of potential. It feels productive at first â€” brainstorming, building, designing â€” but eventually derails real progress.

Honestly, Iâ€™ve been stuck in this loop for a while.

## ðŸ’­ Why Does This Happen?

After reflecting on my patterns, hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve learned:

- **Starting is easy. Finishing is hard.**  
  The beginning of a project is full of inspiration. Finishing it requires discipline, consistency, and often doing the boring stuff.

- **I confuse excitement with progress.**  
  When the novelty wears off, I assume the project isnâ€™t worth pursuing â€” even if it actually is.

- **I fear imperfection.**  
  Maybe I avoid finishing because finishing means showing it to the world â€” and that brings judgment, criticism, or worse, indifference.

- **I lack a system.**  
  Without structure or a workflow, everything falls apart once the initial motivation fades.

- **I get bored.**  
  The more time I spend on a project, the more tired I become of its UI, concept, or even the idea itself.

## ðŸ’ª What Iâ€™m Doing Differently

I'm still figuring it out, but here are a few changes Iâ€™m making:

- **One project at a time.**  
  No matter how tempting it is, I wonâ€™t jump to a new idea until Iâ€™ve finished or officially dropped the current one.

- **Build boring habits.**  
  Motivation is temporary â€” habits last. Iâ€™m training myself to show up daily, especially when itâ€™s not fun.

- **Lower the pressure.**  
  Not every project has to be a game-changer. Sometimes, just finishing something is the real win.

- **Use public accountability.**  
  Sharing progress online, telling friends, or writing blog posts like this keeps me more committed.

- **Keep a simple log.**  
  I now track what Iâ€™ve done, whatâ€™s left, and whatâ€™s blocking me. Surprisingly effective.

Iâ€™ve been stuck in this loop for years, chasing newness and abandoning progress. But I'm trying to be more mindful of the patterns, 
and more intentional about breaking them.
I donâ€™t have all the answers. I might still stumble. But if I can finish just one project â€” even if itâ€™s small, even if itâ€™s messy â€” thatâ€™s a win.
And maybe thatâ€™s how Iâ€™ll finally break the cycle. One imperfect, finished project at a time.

> I actually finished this blog project â€” which feels like a huge win. Iâ€™ve started it two or three times before but never saw it through. This time, I did. And Iâ€™m genuinely happy about that.I want to make this a habit now. One project at a time.
