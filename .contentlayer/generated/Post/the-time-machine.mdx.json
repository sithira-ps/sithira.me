Wells\n\n_Subject_: Science Fiction\n\n_Language_: English\n\n_Source_: [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was\nexpounding a recondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and\ntwinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire\nburnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the\nlilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our\nglasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather\nthan submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious\nafter-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the\ntrammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the\npoints with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his\nearnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.\n\n“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two\nideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,\nthey taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”\n\n“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said\nFilby, an argumentative person with red hair.\n\n“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground\nfor it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of\ncourse that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_, has no real\nexistence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane.\nThese things are mere abstractions.”\n\n“That is all right,” said the Psychologist.\n\n“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a\nreal existence.”\n\n“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All\nreal things—”\n\n“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_ cube\nexist?”\n\n“Don’t follow you,” said Filby.\n\n“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real\nexistence?”\n\nFilby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any\nreal body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have\nLength, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural\ninfirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we\nincline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three\nwhich we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,\nhowever, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former\nthree dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our\nconsciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter\nfrom the beginning to the end of our lives.”\n\n“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his\ncigar over the lamp; “that . . . very clear indeed.”\n\n“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,”\ncontinued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness.\n“Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some\npeople who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It\nis only another way of looking at Time. _There is no difference between\nTime and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our\nconsciousness moves along it_. But some foolish people have got hold of\nthe wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say\nabout this Fourth Dimension?”\n\n“_I_ have not,” said the Provincial Mayor.\n\n“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is\nspoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,\nBreadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three\nplanes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical\npeople have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularly—why not\nanother direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even\ntried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb\nwas expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month\nor so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two\ndimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and\nsimilarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could\nrepresent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the\nthing. See?”\n\n“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows,\nhe lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who\nrepeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some\ntime, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\n\n“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry\nof Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For\ninstance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at\nfifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All\nthese are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional\nrepresentations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and\nunalterable thing.\n\n“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause\nrequired for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time\nis only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a\nweather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of\nthe barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then\nthis morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the\nmercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space\ngenerally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that\nline, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.”\n\n“But,” said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, “if\nTime is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has\nit always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move\nin Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?”\n\nThe Time Traveller smiled. “Are you so sure we can move freely in\nSpace? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,\nand men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions.\nBut how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.”\n\n“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man. “There are balloons.”\n\n“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\ninequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”\n\n“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Medical Man.\n\n“Easier, far easier down than up.”\n\n“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the\npresent moment.”\n\n“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the\nwhole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present\nmoment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no\ndimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform\nvelocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_\nif we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”\n\n“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Psychologist. ’You\n_can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about\nin Time.”\n\n“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that\nwe cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an\nincident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I\nbecome absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course\nwe have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than\na savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a\ncivilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go\nup against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that\nultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the\nTime-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”\n\n“Oh, _this_,” began Filby, “is all—”\n\n“Why not?” said the Time Traveller.\n\n“It’s against reason,” said Filby.\n\n“What reason?” said the Time Traveller.\n\n“You can show black is white by argument,” said Filby, “but you will\nnever convince me.”\n\n“Possibly not,” said the Time Traveller. “But now you begin to see the\nobject of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long\nago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”\n\n“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man.\n\n“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as\nthe driver determines.”\n\nFilby contented himself with laughter.\n\n“But I have experimental verification,” said the Time Traveller.\n\n“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Psychologist\nsuggested. “One might travel back and verify the accepted account of\nthe Battle of Hastings, for instance!”\n\n“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Medical Man.\n“Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”\n\n“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the\nVery Young Man thought.\n\n“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The\nGerman scholars have improved Greek so much.”\n\n“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man. “Just think! One\nmight invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and\nhurry on ahead!”\n\n“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic\nbasis.”\n\n“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Psychologist.\n\n“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—”\n\n“Experimental verification!” cried I. “You are going to verify _that_?”\n\n“The experiment!” cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.\n\n“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Psychologist, “though it’s\nall humbug, you know.”\n\nThe Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and\nwith his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of\nthe room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to\nhis laboratory.\n\nThe Psychologist looked at us. “I wonder what he’s got?”\n\n“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man, and Filby\ntried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he\nhad finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s\nanecdote collapsed.\n",
